# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 1. Project Overview
This project project develops a machine learning model to predict heart disease using daily outpatient data collected form  community health center (Puskesmas). The goal is to support early detection and assist primary care provider in prioritizing preventive care, identifing high-risk patient and medical intervention.
## 2. Objectives
Objectives
- To analyze daily outpatient records to identify potential heart disease risk factors.
- To develop a predictive model for heart disease based on clinical and demographic variables.
- To provide a decision-support tool that can be integrated into primary healthcare workflows.
## 3. Dataset Description
The dataset consists of anonymized daily patient service data collected from a Puskesmas, including variables such as:
	•	Age
	•	Gender
	•	Blood pressure : Sistole, Diastole
	•	Body weight
	•	Height
	•	Smoking habit
	•	Diagnosis
