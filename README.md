# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 1. Project Overview
This project project develops a machine learning model to predict heart disease using daily outpatient data collected form  community health center (Puskesmas). The goal is to support early detection and assist primary care provider in prioritizing preventive care, identifing high-risk patient and medical intervention.
## 2. Objectives
Objectives
- To analyze daily outpatient records to identify potential heart disease risk factors.
- To develop a predictive model for heart disease based on clinical and demographic variables.
- To provide a decision-support tool that can be integrated into primary healthcare workflows.
## 3. Dataset Description
The dataset consists of anonymized daily patient service data collected from a Puskesmas, including variables such as:
- Age
- Gender
- Blood pressure : Sistole, Diastole
- Body weight
- Height
- Smoking habit
- Diagnosis
## 4. Technology Used
- Programming Language: Python 3.10
- IDE: Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  1. Pandas – for data manipulation and preprocessing
  2. Numpy – for numerical computation
  3. Matplotlib & seaborn – for data visualization and exploratory data analysis
  4. Scikit-learn – for machine learning model development and evaluation

## 5. Methodology
	1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, encoding categorical features, handling missing values, and feature selection.
	2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding distributions, correlations, and patterns.
	3. Model Development: Training various models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest using scikit-learn.
	4. Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score.
	5. Interpretation: Visualizing important features and model predictions to aid healthcare decisions.
