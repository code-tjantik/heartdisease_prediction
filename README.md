# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 1. Project Overview
This project project develops a machine learning model to predict heart disease using daily outpatient data collected form  community health center (Puskesmas). The goal is to support early detection and assist primary care provider in prioritizing preventive care, identifing high-risk patient and medical intervention.

# Features

- Predicts likelihood of heart disease based on clinical parameters
- Supports multiple machine learning models : Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree)
- Visualization of data and model performance metrics
- Web interface using Streamlit 

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.8+
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Streamlit 
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset

The dataset used is from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository - Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease).

It contains 14 attributes such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, and more.
